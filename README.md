About me

I am a Scientist (Chemist) and I work in the Life Science Industry.

Programming has been a hobby of mine for the last few years after reading a book about how to code in C. Currently, I code a lot of VBA in my job for automation tools et. but I also made a conciouos effort to learn and use C# for one project to move away from Excel & VBA. I also learnt python on codecademy.com but have not used it for any projects as of yet.

I am intrigued by data science and I am making a deliberate effort to gain all the skills required to persue this:

SQL
Python
Functional Programming
Tableau / data visualization
Git version control

I'm hoping to start some Kaggle competitions and personal projects on here to push my skills :)
